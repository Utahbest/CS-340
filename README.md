How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I organize as much of the code as I can to write legible, flexible, and maintainable code. In writing all of the code for the project/assignments, adhere to industry standards. In order to ensure that anyone reading my code would understand what the code was doing and meant, I utilized variables with easy-to-understand equalization, correct indentation, and as much commenting as I could. To let anyone reading my code know that the read method was below, for instance, I made sure to put comments like "This is the reading function" when I was constructing the CRUD module.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, breaking the project down into its component parts aids in issue solving. Once the parts are arranged in front of you, you may choose where to begin. The next step is to determine which tools are required and what has to be done to solve the issue. I completely destroyed the project with this course and making the dashboard for Grazioso Salvare. greater than only developing the CRUD and testing it. To make sure every line of the CRUD module coded as intended, I also dissected and debugged it. As I discovered in week six, Jupyter Notebook can also split your code frame. Although I wish I had known this earlier, it was a huge assistance.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists come in a wide variety of forms; two examples are coding and general IT. It all depends on the type of computer scientist you are looking for. In any case, they provide answers to a client's inquiry or issue. They first build a program that can carry out the criteria after gathering as much information as possible to ensure the client will have all of them. I learned that the Grazioso Salvage project required a dashboard with all the features they desired, including a geolocation map, a chart, and the ability to filter by the different kinds of rescue canines. The most crucial step is figuring out the client's goals and then developing a program that helps them achieve them. Giving businesses a simpler way to operate is crucial, and computer scientists
